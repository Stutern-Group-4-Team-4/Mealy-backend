# Mealy-backend

To set up the app-core code base;

We created a folder, *src* where all our source code files would be kept.

Inside the *src* folder, we created a subfolder named it *config*. This folder will contain configuration files for the different environments.

In the *config* folder, we created the following files: "development.js", "index.js", "production.js", and "staging.js". These files will hold environment-specific configurations for our app.

Furthermore, we created a file named ".env". An .env file is a text file containing key-value pairs of all the environment variables required by our application..

In the root of our codebase, we created a file named "app.js". This file will serve as the main entry point of our application.

We have installed the necessary dependencies for our application. We are required to install the following dependencies: "dotenv", "express", and "mongoose".
